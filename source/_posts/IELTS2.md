## 论证方法总结

2. 结果: as a result, as a consequence, consequently 
3. 假设：when 
4. 抽象到具体：like, such as 
5. 反面论证: by contrast (最多用一次）


Eg：The participation in community services helps develop students' interpersonal skills. This is because they would meet different peers coming from different background. When asked to finish some tasks, like cleaning a library or taking good care of old people, such teenagers may be encountered with some problems. In this case, they are more likely to cooperate with each other with the aim of successfully and effectively solving the problems. As a result, these adolescents could have a better understanding of the importance of team spirit, which helps them to adjust to a wider community easily. By contrast, those who stay away from such free services may find it hard to adapt to the society where cooperation is of great significance.
